                    Now, let’s have a sneak peek of the top 5 reasons why small
                    businesses need a website in 2021
                  </p>

                  <div className="single-block mb-11">
                    <h3 className="gr-text-6 font-weight-bold pb-3">
                      It gives a professional look
                    </h3>

                    <p className="gr-text-8">
                      A professional website is always the first best impression
                      a client can have during the initial conversation. It
                      makes the initial conversation far more convincing and
                      credible as we position ourselves in front of the client.
                    </p>

                    <p className="gr-text-8">
                      A website also carries the professional certificates and
                      the awards received for the services rendered for the
                      clients to see. Thus, a website presents a holistic
                      picture of what the company does professionally than any
                      other social media could achieve.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <div className="single-block mb-11">
                    <h3 className="gr-text-6 font-weight-bold pb-3">
                      It builds credibility
                    </h3>
                    <p className="gr-text-8">
                      Any business looks for credibility to start with and a
                      website is the first thing that a client asks for to know
                      you, like how long you are into the business, your
                      previous track records, the current endeavours and
                      customer’s review.
                    </p>

                    <p className="gr-text-8">
                      The best reviews and testimonials by the existing clients
                      on your website is a great way to establish social proof.
                      Even if small businesses doing great through word of mouth
                      would still be missing out on the referrals who look for a
                      professional website.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <div className="single-block mb-11">
                    <h3 className="gr-text-6 font-weight-bold pb-3">
                      It helps in showcasing products and services
                    </h3>
                    <p className="gr-text-8">
                      What could be a better way to showcase small business
                      owners products and services than a professional website.
                      A properly designed website will not only showcase your
                      business products and services, it also helps in boosting
                      sales. Websites containing the images and appropriate
                      product information can attract the right kind of
                      customers who remain hooked and go nowhere else to
                      purchase.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <div className="single-block mb-11">

                      Retain existing customers and build new ones
                    </h3>
                    <p className="gr-text-8">
                      Selling to an existing customer has a success rate of
                      60-70%, so my implementing strategies like a loyalty
                      program, rewarding customer feedback and exceptional
                      customer support will always help in retaining the
                      existing customers.
                    </p>

                    <p className="gr-text-8">
                      A website not only helps in retaining existing customers
                      When managed correctly, it can also help you attract
                      prospective potential customers. Some people don't like to
                      talk, those customers can reach you through the contact us
                      forms easily. The SEO and a few other features have made
                      it easier and hassle-free for customers to reach you. A
                      good user interface also helps in retaining old customers
                      and creating a new ones.

                      The price of having a website is lesser than staying
                      behind
                    </h3>
                    <p className="gr-text-8">
                      Websites have better standing when thinking of digital
                      marketing and it's beneficial for the long run of the
                      business. The amount spent in constructing a website is
                      minuscule when compared to the ROI earned through a
                      professional website. If you still think that a small
                      business does not require a website for its cost, it's
                      time to rethink, you can beat the remaining 40% who don't
                      have one.

                    <p className="gr-text-8">
                      In a nutshell, a professional website is not a frivolous
                      endeavour, it's a very much affordable and an important
                      tool to survive in today’s competitive world.
